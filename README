A complete editor for EGA SCI games. You can edit pics, views, script source code, text resources, cursors, fonts, the main vocab file. You can create new games or explore the resources of various sci0 games.

Featuring an updated template game, the source files on which your games are created, with a number of bug fixes and an improved compiler. Far less crash prone than it's predecessor SCI Studio, SCI Companion is the preferred studio of the SCI Community.
